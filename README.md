This is made so that you can choose a pokemon and see what it says about you. 
First you click Who you choose? Type in your favorite pokemon and get your results!
I started with the html then went to the js. 
It took me awhile to figure out what I wanted it to do. I love pokemon and love reading about the different types. So I wanted to know what my type meant.
