This is made so that you can choose a pokemon and see what it says about you.
First you click Who you choose? Type in your favorite pokemon and get your results!
I started with the html then went to the js. 
It took me awhile to figure out what I wanted it to do. I love pokemon and love reading about the different types. So I wanted to know what my type meant. 
I first started with the html to get everthing I wanted added. Then looked into the ajax link to find what I was looking for. The hardest thing for me was trying to code out the ajax objects. 
Some problems that I had was trying to get the pokemon to stay on the ground. Over all I really enjoyed doing this project and it taught me alot.
